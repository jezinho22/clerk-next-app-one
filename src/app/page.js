    <h2>Your handy helper for naming your new-born</h2>
    <h3>What it is for</h3>
    <p>Your child may not always be called by the name you give them.</p>
    <p>This site helps you look at what the name you give your child could become in the hands of others.</p>
    <p>Most likely it will be something you could easily think of: Samuel becoming Sam or Sammy.</p>
    <p>But combine it with a surname and things can be less predictable and also less happy.</p>
    <p>Benjamin could become Benjy, Benny, Ben. But Benjamin Dover could easily be Bend Over forever, after the first day of high school!</p>
    <h3>Know the risks</h3>
    <p>Post the name you are thinking of here, and the community will let you know the possible nicknames.</p>
    <p>Then you can make a fully informed choice.</p>
